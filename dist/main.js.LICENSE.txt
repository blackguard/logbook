//!!!

//!!! Also, the following does not work on Firefox:

//!!! THIS NO LONGER WORKS: return document.execCommand('paste');  // updates selection

//!!! audit this !!!

//!!! could be more careful not to create empty text nodes here

//!!! could use structuredClone(), but would that prevent remove() from finding?

//!!! event handler never removed

//!!! implement this

//!!! improve #ui

//!!! incorrect comparison

//!!! is this a correct implementation???

//!!! no stats

//!!! options is not copied, and yet is used later

//!!! plaintext-only not supported in Firefox as of version 118

//!!! review this !!!

//!!! should be configurable

//!!! should other members of options be checked (e.g., "once")?

//!!! this.#eval_states_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_commands_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_selects_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! what a kludge...
