//!!!

//!!! audit this !!!

//!!! could use structuredClone(), but would that prevent remove() from finding?

//!!! event handler never removed

//!!! implement this

//!!! improve #ui

//!!! incorrect comparison

//!!! never unsubscribed

//!!! no stats

//!!! options is not copied, and yet is used later

//!!! review this !!!

//!!! should be configurable

//!!! should other members of options be checked (e.g., "once")?

//!!! this will reset the user's theme setting if not dark or light (the default)

//!!! this.#eval_states_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_commands_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_selects_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! until we figure out how to detect a changed document

//!!! what a kludge...
