//!!! Also, the following does not work on Firefox:

//!!! THIS NO LONGER WORKS: return document.execCommand('paste');  // updates selection

//!!! could be more careful not to create empty text nodes here

//!!! could use structuredClone(), but would that prevent remove() from finding?

//!!! event handler never removed

//!!! implement this

//!!! incorrect comparison

//!!! is this a correct implementation???

//!!! this.#eval_states_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_commands_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! this.#menubar_selects_subscription is never unsubscribed

//!!! what a kludge...

//!!!autoeval: { initial: this.autoeval,  on: (event) => this.set_autoeval(!this.autoeval) },//!!!
